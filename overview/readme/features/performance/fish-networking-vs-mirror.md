# Fish-Networking Vs Mirror

{% hint style="danger" %}
These benchmarks are very old. Server outbound bandwidth metrics have changed.

As of the date 2023/08/26 Mirror is believed to be approximately 5% more efficient in bandwidth, and Fish-Networking about 90-95% more efficient in bandwidth.

Example:

if Mirror previously sent 100mB/s they are now expected to send 95mB/s.

If Fish-Networking previously sent 100mB/s it would now send 5mB/s
