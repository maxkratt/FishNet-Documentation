# Development

## Making Suggestions

The best way to make suggestions is to post on our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/FirstGearGames/FishNet/discussions) page. Once posted you'll be able to follow comments and progress.

## Reporting Bugs

We appreciate all bug reports that our users may have, and make a strong effort to resolve them. We have a guide for how to post bug reports on our GitHub [here](../../../guides/troubleshooting/creating-bug-reports/).

## Making Code Contributions

We welcome all kinds of code contributions to Fish-Networking, including bug fixes, new features, and improvements. We have bounties for any serious exploits that can be found and also miscellaneous bounties for other features. If you have something you'd like to work on, please head over to the [open-development](https://discord.com/channels/424284635074134018/923983677980045382) channel in our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/Ta9HgDh4Hj) and have a chat with us. We also welcome pull requests on our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/FirstGearGames/FishNet/pulls).

## Making Documentation Improvements

Our documentation is open-source, and we encourage our users to contribute content and fix any mistakes that it may contain. You can do so directly on the [Documentation GitHub Repository](https://github.com/FirstGearGames/FishNet-Documentation).

If you don't want to make changes you can also suggest documentation improvements on our [GitHub Discussions page](https://github.com/FirstGearGames/FishNet/discussions).

## Creating Guides, Tutorials, Samples, and Add-Ons

If you have a desire to create guides, tutorials, samples, or add-ons for FishNet, it would be most appreciated by us and the community. You can share such creations with the community directly in our Discord server, but you are also welcome to post them on YouTube, Itch.io, or any other site you want to.

If you want to use the FishNet branding in your creations, you can find it here: [branding.md](../branding.md "mention")
