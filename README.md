# What Is FishNet?

## Overview

Fish-Networking (FishNet) is an original free versatile networking solution for [Unity](https://unity.com/), built from the ground up, offering more features than any other free solution.

FishNet is server authoritative by design by allowing the use of dedicated servers, but does permit users to act as server and client, for faster development and testing. **There are no CCU caps or CCU paywalls in FishNet**, you can also use any server host you want to, including hosting the server yourself or letting your players do it.

Any kind of network topology is supported through the Transport system. Transports can use a variety of technologies to allow communications between server, client, and even third parties.

High-level API allows you to quickly access the ability to synchronize states, logic, objects, and more, without needing to get your hands dirty. We also believe in providing the best experience possible; you may additionally utilize low-level functionality via included events or inheritance.

## No-break promise

Developing projects can take a lot of time, and updating your networking solution along the way is often inevitable. Fish-Networking promises to not release any breaking API or behavior changes between major versions. Major releases will occur no more frequent than every six months, unless **absolutely necessary**.

When breaks do occur we will do our best to keep the changes simple. We also have our [Break Solutions](guides/updating-fishnet/upgrading-api.md) section which will describe planned breaks, the next major release, and how to remedy breaks for each version.

## Long-Term support

Fish-Networking is the only solution to offer free LTS. We will be using a unique but effective approach at creating LTS releases. Rather than the standard expectations of being locked into a version for long-term support, FishNet is providing what we refer to as 'Release' and 'Development' switches. Any version of Fish-Networking which ends in R supports switching between Release and Development features, for example: 3.10.7R.

With Fish-Networking Long-Term support does not mean being stuck on older versions! Whenever a change or new feature becomes available public you may disabled it at anytime. Disabling an upcoming change will suspend the changes and allow FishNet to operate on the proven stable version of the same feature. This allows you to stay on the latest releases to get the latest tech and bug fixes without worrying about each update breaking your project.

To toggle between beta features simply use the Fish-Networking menu in engine, choose Beta, and turn on or off each feature to your liking.
