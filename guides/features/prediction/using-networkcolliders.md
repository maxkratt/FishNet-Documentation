# Using NetworkColliders

When using client-side prediction the NetworkCollider components are designed to accurately dispatch Enter, Stay, and Exit callbacks for collisions and triggers.

All events have the same name across each component: NetworkCollider, NetworkCollider2D, NetworkTrigger, and NetworkTrigger2D. What is returned in each event naturally will vary, depending on which component you use. For example, the NetworkCollision component will return _Collider_ for what was intersected, while NetworkCollision2D will return _Collider2D._

{% hint style="warning" %}
Our OnStay callback does not return _Collision_ as you would expect with the Unity version. Due to Unity limitations we are unable to provide a Collision callback without hotpath allocations.

If you require Collision to be returned please use the Unity OnStay callback instead; this will function properly with prediction.
{% endhint %}

## Callbacks

**OnEnter** is invoked when this collider has entered the bounds of another collider.

**OnStay** is invoked when this collider remains in contact with another.

**OnExit** is invoked when this collider has exited the bounds of another collider.

{% hint style="info" %}
Keep in mind each callback description varies if you are using Collsion, Trigger, or their 2D counterparts. None-the-less, they behave just like Unity callbacks.
{% endhint %}

## Usage

This example script is placed on the player object. Our script demonstrates subscribing to all three events and using the `OnEnter` event to play a sound, as well applying forces to 'this' player.

```csharp
// We are assuming this script inherits NetworkBehaviour.
[SerializeField]
private AudioSource _hitSound;

private NetworkCollision _networkCollision;

private void Awake()
{
    // Get the NetworkCollision component placed on this object.
    // You can place the component anywhere you would normally
    // use Unity collider callbacks!
    _networkCollision = GetComponent<NetworkCollision>();
    // Subscribe to the desired collision event
    _networkCollision.OnEnter += NetworkCollisionEnter;
    _networkCollision.OnStay += NetworkCollisionStay;
    _networkCollision.OnExit += NetworkCollisionExit;
}

private void OnDestroy()
{
    // Since the NetworkCollider is placed on the same object as
    // this script we do not need to unsubscribe; the callbacks
    // will be destroyed with the object.

    // But if your NetworkCollider resides on another object you
    // likely will want to unsubscribe to your events as well as shown.
    if (_networkCollision != null)
    {
        _networkCollision.OnEnter -= NetworkCollisionEnter;
        _networkCollision.OnStay -= NetworkCollisionStay;
        _networkCollision.OnExit -= NetworkCollisionExit;
    }
}

private void NetworkCollisionEnter(Collider other)
{
    // Only play the sound effect when not currently reconciling.
    // If you were to play the sound also during reconciliations
    // the audio would execute each reconcile, each tick, until the
    // player was no longer reconciling into the collider.
    if (!base.PredictionManager.IsReconciling)
        _hitSound.Play();
        
    // Always apply velocity to this player on enter, even if reconciling.
    PlayerMover pm = GetComponent<PlayerMover>();
    // For this example we are pushing away from the other object.
    Vector3 dir = (transform.position - other.gameObject.transform).normalized;
    pm.PredictionRigidbody.AddForce(dir * 50f, ForceMode.Impulse);
}

private void NetworkCollisionStay(Collider other)
{
    // Handle collision stay logic
}

private void NetworkCollisionExit(Collider other)
{
    // Handle collision exit logic (e.g., deactivate visual effects)
}
```

You may be wondering what is PredictionRigidbody and why did we apply forces to that instead of the Rigidbody directly. PredictionRigidbody(and 2D) is a mandatory but still simple way to apply forces to predicted rigidbodies. You can learn more about it's usage [here](predictionrigidbody.md).
