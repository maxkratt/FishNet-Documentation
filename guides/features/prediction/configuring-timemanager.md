# Configuring TimeManager

When using prediction it is essential that Fish-Networkings timing system is used. By default Unity's timing is used, but this can be changed on the TimeManager component.

Add the TimeManager component to your NetworkManager if it does not already exist.

Once added change the Physics Mode to **Time Manager**, and you are done.
