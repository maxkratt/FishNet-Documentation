# Setting up a Camera

When it comes to multiplayer, a player's camera setup can often seem quite tricky to understand. In reality it's often quite simple, only one camera should exist for your local player.&#x20;

The most reliable method is to create a camera prefab and instantiate it locally when the player's character spawns. Alternatively, you can place a camera in the scene ahead of time and have the playerâ€™s object "claim" it upon spawning.

Things get a bit more nuanced when working with [Cinemachine](https://unity.com/features/cinemachine). We'll briefly explore how to manage this setup effectively.
