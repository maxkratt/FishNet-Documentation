## Our recommended service

**PlayFlow Cloud**, a company we've had the pleasure of working with firsthand, is recommended as our top-pick for a hosting service. Their outstanding support, reliable service, and superior pricing have consistently impressed our staff and community.

## Other services

Here is a non-extensive selection of other hosting services that work well with FishNet.

### Dedicated servers

These hosts offer session-based servers, as well persistent servers. Relay services may be available as well.

### Relays only

These are relay only services.
