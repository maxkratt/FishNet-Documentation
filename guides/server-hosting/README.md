# Server Hosting

## What does Server Hosting entail?

Server hosting involves renting or utilizing a server to host your game's files and services. A server host is essential for game deployment because it provides the infrastructure and resources necessary to manage server loads, enable online gameplay, and ensure the game is accessible to players around the world. It also facilitates updates, balances traffic, and maintains security, which are crucial for a smooth gaming experience.

FishNet supports any server hosting you choose, and you can also manage it completely yourself, including letting your players host servers themselves or act as a host.
