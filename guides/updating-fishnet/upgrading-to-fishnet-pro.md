### Unity Asset Store

Purchasing and installing via the Unity Asset Store should be very familiar to a regular Unity user. With this method you will have lifetime access to FishNet and be able to download the latest version available on the Asset Store through the Unity Package Manager.

1. Open your Unity project.
2. Go to **Window > Asset Store** or visit the [Unity Asset Store online](https://assetstore.unity.com/).
3. Search for **FishNet Pro** or navigate to this link: [https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/fishnet-pro-networking-evolved-287711](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/fishnet-pro-networking-evolved-287711)
4. Click **Buy Now**, proceed with the payment, and then click **Open in Unity**.
5. In Unity, go to **Package Manager** (`Window > Package Manager`).
6. Select **My Assets**, find **FishNet Pro**, and click **Download** and then **Import**.

{% hint style="success" %}
You can also gain access to Priority Support with your asset store purchase! Your priority support months begin only after you claim your perks on our Discord; see [After Purchasing](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/overview/readme/pro-projects-and-support#after-purchasing) please.

The amount of months received are directly related to what goes back into the project after Unity's fees. If you purchase Fish-Networking Pro at $50 you will receive 4 months of Priority Support, and 2 months at $25.
