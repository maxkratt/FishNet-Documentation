# Updating FishNet

Before making large changes to your project, it's always advised to back it up by using your version control software or a manual backup. We advise doing this step first before trying to update your FishNet version, even if the likelihood of it breaking anything is quite small.

If you have a project using the free version of FishNet and want to update it to FishNet Pro, you can follow these exact same steps.
{% endhint %}

### Steps

1. Make a project backup/commit.
2. Uninstall FishNet. You can do this from the Package Manager or by deleting the FishNet folder in the Unity Editor.
3. Don't close Unity
4. Import the FishNet Pro version from one of the methods listed above.

Your project should now be correctly updated to the latest version, if you run into any issues along the way, please feel free to reach out for help in our discord server: [https://discord.gg/Ta9HgDh4Hj](https://discord.gg/Ta9HgDh4Hj)
