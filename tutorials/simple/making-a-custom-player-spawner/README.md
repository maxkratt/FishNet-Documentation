# Making a Custom Player Spawner

In many games, you'll often need to spawn a **GameObject** to represent a player. This can happen at various points during gameplayâ€”such as when a player first connects, once a specific number of players have joined, after a particular scene finishes loading, or when the host initiates it with a button press.&#x20;

FishNet includes a default [PlayerSpawner](../../../fishnet-building-blocks/components/playerspawner.md) component designed primarily as a quick-start tool and reference example. It automatically spawns a player object for each client upon successful connection and authentication. It also has the option to define specific player spawn points, and if multiple spawn points are provided, the component will rotate through them sequentially.

If this functionality is sufficient for your game, then you can go ahead and use the default one, if not, let's look at how to implement our own to handle different use cases.
