# DualPrefabObjects

The Dual Prefab Objects asset can be used to have Fish-Networking spawn a different prefab on the clients as it uses on the server. Whenever you spawn the server selected version, FishNet will spawn the client version on all clients.

{% hint style="success" %}
You can select the same prefab in both the Server and Client fields to have the same one spawned on all clients as the server.
{% endhint %}
