# DefaultPrefabObjects

The **Default Prefab Objects** asset is a dynamically populated collection of spawnable network objects. FishNet automatically generates it in the designated directory specified in your Fish-Networking configuration, filling it with networked prefabs from the configured locations.

{% hint style="info" %}
You do not need to manually populate or update this collection, FishNet will take care of it automatically.
{% endhint %}
