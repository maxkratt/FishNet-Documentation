# ObserverConditions

**ObserverConditions** in Fish-Networking define specific conditions under which clients receive updates about a [NetworkObject's](../../../guides/features/networked-gameobjects-and-scripts/networkobjects/) state. These conditions help optimize network traffic by ensuring that only relevant updates are transmitted, as well as prevent client's from cheating by only sending relevant data to individual clients.
