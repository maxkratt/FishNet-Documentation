# Yak (Pro Feature)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Yak is part of Fish-Networking Pro features.
{% endhint %}

## Description

An offline transport that runs off your multiplayer code. No local or remote connections are made using this transport.

Besides being an offline transport, Yak API behaves exactly as our many other transports. In result, you do not need to change any of your code to take advantage of Yak.

To support offline play and online play you will want to consider using [Multipass](multipass.md) with Yak and an online transport of your choice.
