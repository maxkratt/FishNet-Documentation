  synchronizing data, responding to network events, and handling remote
  procedure calls (RPCs).

# NetworkBehaviour

## Description

NetworkBehaviour(s) cannot be added to objects directly. This script must be inherited from before it may be included on an object. Inheriting from NetworkBehaviour allows access to [network communications](../../guides/high-level-overview/terminology/communicating.md) and other useful data about the network, server, and client.&#x20;

Each NetworkBehaviour must be attached to a GameObject that also has a NetworkObject component on it or one of its parent objects.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Adding a NetworkBehaviour derived component at run-time is not yet supported.
{% endhint %}

Please check out the guide page for more information about all the things you can do with NetworkBehaviours:
