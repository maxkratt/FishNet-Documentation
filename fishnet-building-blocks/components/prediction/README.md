# Prediction

There are a number of components specifically used for prediction. These include components specifically tied to the [Client-Side Prediction system](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] as well as ones that [are not](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]. Other components such as the NetworkObject can also have settings related to prediction, but they are not included in this subsection.

{% hint style="info" %}
Also consider viewing the [PredictionManager](../managers/predictionmanager.md) to customize global prediction settings.
{% endhint %}

[^1]: For example the NetworkColliders

[^2]: For example the Predicted Spawn and Predicted Owner
