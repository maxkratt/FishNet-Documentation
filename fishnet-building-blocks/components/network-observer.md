# NetworkObserver

## Description <a href="#conditions" id="conditions"></a>

The **NetworkObserver** uses conditions to determine if a client qualifies to be an observer of an object; any number of conditions may be used and a client will be considered an observer of the object if he passes all active conditions. The NetworkObserver component can be used to override the [ObserverManager](managers/observermanager/), or add additional conditions onto the object to which the NetworkObserver is added.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When adding this component manually, be careful not to unintentionally override the default scene observer condition of the object by using the **Ignore Manager** override type setting.
{% endhint %}

This component will be added to a network object at run-time if it doesn't already exist.

{% hint style="success" %}
Check out the API page for specific methods, and properties [here](https://fish-networking.com/FishNet/api/api/FishNet.Observing.NetworkObserver.html).
{% endhint %}

## Conditions <a href="#conditions" id="conditions"></a>

There are [several included conditions](../scriptableobjects/observerconditions/), which may be used together. ObserverCondition may also be inherited from [to make your own conditions](../../guides/features/observers/custom-conditions.md). When all conditions are true, the object will become visible to the client.

Each condition must be created as a scriptable object, and dropped into the Network Observer component.

### :gear: **Override Type**

> This is used to change how the **NetworkObserver** component uses the [ObserverManager](managers/observermanager/) settings. _Add Missing_ will add any conditions from the ObserverManager which are not already on the NetworkObserver. _UseManager_ replaces conditions with those from the manager. _Ignore Manager_ will keep the NetworkObserver conditions, ignoring the ObserverManager entirely.
>
> _Add Missing_ is usually the recommended option.

### :gear: **Update Host Visibility**

> This will change the visibility of renderers for the host client when server objects are not visible to the client. If you wish to enable and disable other aspects during a visibility change consider using the [`NetworkObject.OnHostVisibilityUpdated`](https://fish-networking.com/FishNet/api/api/FishNet.Object.NetworkObject.html#FishNet_Object_NetworkObject_OnHostVisibilityUpdated) event.

> This is a list of which observer conditions to use. You can find out more about the specific ones here: [observerconditions](../scriptableobjects/observerconditions/ "mention")
