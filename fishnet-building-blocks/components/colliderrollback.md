# ColliderRollback

<details>

<summary>Settings <em>are general settings related to ColliderRollback.</em></summary>

**Bounding Box** configures how a bounding box is added to the object. When set to Disabled a bounding box will not be added. Additional settings are displayed when not set to Disabled.

* **Physics Type** is which type of physics you plan on rolling back, and determines if a Physics collider is added, or Physics2D collider.
* **Bounding Box Size** determines how large of a bounding box to add. Typically a value three times larger than the world space of your object is sufficient. For example, if your object is a Vector3.one cube, this value would Vector3(3f, 3f, 3f). If an object is exceptionally fast moving consider making this larger.

**Collider Parents** are transforms you wish to send back in time when performing a rollback. For best results put your hitboxes on their own transform, which is a child of the object the hitbox is for. A setup example is provided as a demo within FishNet\Demos\ColliderRollback.
