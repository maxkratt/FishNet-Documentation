# DefaultScene

## Description

This component will automatically change between online and offline scenes depending on server and client connective state. When a connection is started the online scene is loaded, and when disconnected the offline scene is loaded. This component must be placed on or beneath your [NetworkManager](../managers/network-manager.md).

{% hint style="success" %}
Check out the API page for specific methods [here](https://fish-networking.com/FishNet/api/api/FishNet.Component.Scenes.DefaultScene.html).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
For this component to work, both the online scene and the offline scene must be selected in the inspector, and they must not be the same scene.
{% endhint %}
