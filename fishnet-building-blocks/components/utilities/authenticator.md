# Authenticator

Authenticator logic can be fully customized by inheriting from the _**Authenticator**_ script, and placing your created authenticator within the [Server Manager component](../managers/server-manager.md). There are a few example authenticators that come installed with the FishNet package within the `FishNet/Demos/Authenticator/Scripts` directory.
