# DebugManager

## Description <a href="#server-and-host" id="server-and-host"></a>

The **Debug Manager** component can be used to gain extra information and temporarily tweak certain networking aspects to assist in debugging errors in your game. For example, if you are running into Scene ID errors you can enable the Detailed Writing of Scene Objects to know the object names instead of just IDs. These settings often come at the cost of a little more bandwidth used and are only enabled in the Editor and Development builds of your game.
