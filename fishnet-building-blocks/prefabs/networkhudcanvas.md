# NetworkHudCanvas

The NetworkHudCanvas prefab can be used to show a simple Heads-Up Display in your game allowing you to quickly start and stop the FishNet server and client.

It also allows you to set an **Auto Start Type**, which will dictate how FishNet behaves as soon as the object is loaded in the game.
