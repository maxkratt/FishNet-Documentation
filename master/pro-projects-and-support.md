# Pro, Projects, and Support

## Purchasing

There are a variety of ways to purchase Pro and Projects.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please read the following very carefully to ensure you understand it fully. If you have questions please contact staff on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Ta9HgDh4Hj).
{% endhint %}

There are two types of purchases, **Fish-Networking Pro**, and **Projects**.

**Fish-Networking Pro** can be purchased from [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/FirstGearGames), [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/firstgeargames), or the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/46529).

At this time **Projects** can only be purchased through GitHub and Patreon.

Once FPSLand V4 is complete projects will be added to the asset store as well.

_Please consider making purchases through GitHub as our preferred platform, or Patreon. When purchased through GitHub or Patreon more of your support goes towards the developers and community helpers._

_In addition, GitHub and Patreon offer extra bonuses as a thank you!_

### GitHub and Patreon Perks

{% hint style="info" %}
Becoming a supporter is designed to be indie-dev and budget friendly.
{% endhint %}

When obtaining  Fish-Networking Pro through GitHub or Patreon you will have access to both Pro and Projects.

You **must** make a one-time payment of $10 for your initial downloads. Afterwards you're welcome to switch to $2/month for updates. You may leave the updates tier and join us again at any time.

When on any $10 tier or higher you will gain access to Priority Support, this includes your initial purchase; see [support tier options](pro-projects-and-support.md#support-tier-options) for more information on this.

{% hint style="info" %}
Business support tiers are **only** available on GitHub.
{% endhint %}

**Lifetime Benefits:**

{% hint style="success" %}
You can get bonus Priority Support months on GitHub!

Our one-time $60 GitHub option provides lifetime access to Pro and Project downloads, as well 8 total months of Priority Support, rather than 6 months of Priority Support when purchased monthly.
{% endhint %}

* Lifetime updates to both Pro and Projects can be obtained by supporting over-time, or by a one-time payment.&#x20;
* Lifetime updates to projects are received after your total contributing meets $35.
* Lifetime updates to Fish-Networking Pro are received after your total contribution meets $60.
* Should you sponsor $200 at once or over-time, you will also gain lifetime access to Priority Support.

{% hint style="info" %}
All higher tiers provide access to any content beneath them.

For example: If you have access to Fish-Networking Pro, you also have access to Projects.
{% endhint %}

### Unity Asset Store Perks

Asset store purchases provide lifetime updates to Fish-Networking Pro.

You can also gain access to Priority Support with your asset store purchase!  Your priority support months begin only after you claim your perks on our Discord; see [After Purchasing](pro-projects-and-support.md#after-purchasing) please.

{% hint style="info" %}
The amount of months received are directly related to what goes back into the project after Unity's fees. If you purchase Fish-Networking Pro at $50 you will receive 4 months of Priority Support, and 2 months at $25.
{% endhint %}

## After Purchasing

{% hint style="danger" %}
Projects are only available when purchasing through GitHub or Patreon.
{% endhint %}

Access Fish-Networking Pro and Projects on our [website](https://firstgeargames.com), or if you purchased on the asset store use your purchases asset link provided by Unity.

Please keep in mind that you may change your support tier at anytime when joining us through GitHub or Patreon.

{% hint style="info" %}
Do not forget your Discord roles!
{% endhint %}

You can claim supporter roles on our Discord no matter what purchase technique you use, but as previously said GitHub offers the most benefits per dollar.&#x20;

Roles show off that you're a supporter, and are crucial for gaining you access to our priority help channels if you're on a Priority Support tier.

Business tiers are unique in that they receive dedicated channels. Please contact FirstGearGames on Discord to have your support channel created.

**How to claim your role:**

* **GitHub Instructions:** log into your downloads on our website. After logging in you will be shown a temporary Id above downloads. Copy this Id and direct message our Discord bot Sharky with it.
* **Patreon Instructions:** [https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266-Get-my-Discord-role.](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266-Get-my-Discord-role.)
* **Asset Store Instructions:** Join our Discord and message Sharky your purchase invoice number.

## Pro

Some features are only available in Fish-Networking Pro.

All business [support tiers](pro-projects-and-support.md#support-tier-options) also grant a complimentary lifetime Pro license.

{% hint style="success" %}
We have an extremely flexible sharing license for Fish-Networking Pro, allowing teams and classrooms to work on a single purchase. You can view that license [here](https://github.com/FirstGearGames/FishNet/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
{% endhint %}

#### Features For Pro:

> **Lag Compensation**
>
> Another very important feature for precision based gaming is lag compensation. This is the act of rolling back colliders in time to where a client had seen them; this ensures accurate hit registration. This technique is applicable to several genre types but is most commonly seen in shooter games

> **Automatic Code Stripping**
>
> Code stripping helps protect your game server by removing sensitive logic that the player should not be aware of. Far as we know, Fish-Networking is the only solution with the ability to remove server code from clients, and client code from the server.

> **Network Level of Detail**
>
> Level of Detail determines how often the server sends updates to clients. With level of detail enabled moving objects can expect to use up to 95% LESS bandwidth. Other aspects of Fish-Networking benefit marginally from network level of detail as well.

> **Extrapolation, NetworkTransform**
>
> When enabled the NetworkTransform will extrapolate as necessary to create a smoother experience for unstable connections.

> **Synchronized Parameters, NetworkAnimator**
>
> Customize which parameters are synchronized over the network on the NetworkAnimator.

> **Yak**
>
> [Yak](../manual/guides/components/transports/yak-pro-feature.md) is a transport which provides an entirely offline experience using your multiplayer code. When combined with Multipass (available to free users), you may run your game offline or online.

## Projects

Projects are completed Unity projects which act as a template or learning opportunity.

> **Lobby and Worlds**
>
> Lobby and Worlds is designed to use a single server for a lobby containing your players, as well create games on the same server using rooms created by your players. Each room is isolated from other players, both visually and in network traffic.
>
> Many aspects of the lobby can be customized to your needs. Lobby and Worlds allows you to design your game normally in it's own scenes, while the project takes care of everything else.
>
> Features include:
>
> * Loading any number of game scenes, multiple times; think dungeon instances!
> * Sign in system.
> * Lobby to create and join rooms.
> * Join rooms after start, optional.
> * Password rooms.
> * Ready up system, optional.
> * Kick players.
> * Player limits.
> * Customizable lobby logic and demo game.
