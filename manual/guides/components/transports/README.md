# Transports

## General

Tugboat is the default transport and will be added to your project at runtime. If you wish to use a different transport or customize Tugboat you must add the component to your NetworkManager object.



## [Multipass Transport](multipass.md)

Multipass allows servers to utilize multiple transports at once, you may want to use FishyEOS or Unity Transport to support your console users, but also use Tugboat to give a better experience to your Non-Console users. In any case this allows the developer to pick and choose what fits best for their game

Clients can only ever be on One Transport. More info on the Component page and Guide.&#x20;
