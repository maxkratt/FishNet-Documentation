  Custom serializers are useful where an automatic serializer may not be
  possible, or where you want data to be serialized in a specific manner.

# Custom Serializers

When creating a custom serializer there are a few important things to remember. When you follow the proper steps your custom serializer will be found and used by Fish-Networking. Your custom serializers can also override automatic serializers, but not included ones.

* Your method must be static, and within a static class.
* Writing method names must begin with _Write_.
* Reading method names must begin with _Read_.
* The first parameter must be _this Writer_ for writers, and _this Reader_ for readers.
* Data must be read in the same order it is written.

Although _Vector2_ is already supported, the example below uses a Vector2 for simplicity sake.

```csharp
//Write each axis of a Vector2.
public static void WriteVector2(this Writer writer, Vector2 value)
{
    writer.WriteSingle(value.x);
    writer.WriteSingle(value.y);
}

//Read and return a Vector2.
public static Vector2 ReadVector2(this Reader reader)
{
    return new Vector2()
    {
        x = reader.ReadSingle(),
        y = reader.ReadSingle()
    };
}
```

Custom serializers are more commonly used for conditional situations where what you write may change depending on the data values. Here is a more complex example where certain data is only written when it's needed.

```csharp
/* This is the type we are going to write.
* We will save data and populate default values
* by not writing energy/energy regeneration if
* the enemy does not have energy. */
public struct Enemy
{
    public bool HasEnergy;
    public float Health;
    public float Energy;
    public float EnergyRegeneration;
}

public static void WriteEnemy(this Writer writer, Enemy value)
{
    writer.WriteBoolean(value.HasEnergy);
    writer.WriteSingle(value.Health);
    
    //Only need to write energy and energy regeneration if HasEnergy is true.
    if (value.HasEnergy)
    {
        writer.WriteSingle(value.Energy);
        writer.WriteSingle(value.EnergyRenegeration);
    }
}

public static Enemy ReadEnemy(this Reader reader)
{
    Enemy e = new Enemy();
    e.HasEnergy = reader.ReadBoolean();
    e.Health = reader.ReadSingle();
    
    //If there is energy also read energy values.
    if (e.HasEnergy)
    {
        e.Energy = reader.ReadSingle();
        e.EnergyRenegeration = reader.ReadSingle();
    }

    return e;
}
```

Often when creating a custom serializer you want to use it across your entire project, and all assemblies. Without taking any action further your custom serializer would **only be used on the assembly it is written.** Presumably, that's probably not what you want.

But making a custom serializer work across all assemblies is very simple. Simply add the \[UseGlobalCustomSerializer] attribute of the type your custom serializer is for, and done!

Example:

```csharp
[UseGlobalCustomSerializer]
public struct Enemy
{
    public bool HasEnergy;
    public float Health;
    public float Energy;
    public float EnergyRegeneration;
}
```
