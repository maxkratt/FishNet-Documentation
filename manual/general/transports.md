# Transports

Transports control how data is sent, received, and handled over the network. Fish-Net uses events internally to plug into transport messages. Although it be unlikely you would need to access such messages, they are available to you for your development as well.

There are several transports already available.

* [Tugboat](../guides/components/transports/tugboat.md) (LiteNetLib).
* [Bayou](../guides/components/transports/bayou.md) (WebGL).
* [Yak](../guides/components/transports/yak-pro-feature.md) (For offline gameplay).
* [Multipass](../guides/components/transports/multipass.md) (Multi-transport support).
